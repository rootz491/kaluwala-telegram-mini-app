# Kaluwala — Telegram Mini‑App Bot

This project is a small Telegram bot that provides an "Open Blog" button so readers can open your blog inside Telegram's Web App view.

Use this repository as the bot that connects your blog to Telegram. It supports subscribing users so they can receive notifications when new posts are published.

If you want any changes to the behavior, feel, or messaging — tell me what you'd like and I can update the implementation.
